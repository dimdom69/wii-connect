# Description #
WiiConnect is a tool to connect Wii users to eachother, without the hassle of Nintendo's "safe" crap. It will eventually be able to do many things (hopefully) listed below.

# Feature List #

  * Homebrew Browser integration, or a homebrew downloader made by me if integration doesn't work out
  * Chat (Hopefully many protocols eventually)
  * E-mail (POP3, IMAP, SMTP)
  * Public Profiles
  * News Reader (RSS feed reader, with a Wii News RSS feed)
  * Ability to poke other users on WiiConnect, no matter what feature they are using
  * And More!

# Features it won't Have #

  * Parental Controls
  * Internet Safety Options
  * Friend Codes
